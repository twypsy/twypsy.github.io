description: A review of the free course offered by Mastermind Assurance

## Intro

As part of my studying journey on the ISO 27001 standard, I came across an [ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Lead Auditor](https://learn.mastermindassurance.com/products/courses/iso-27001-lead-auditor) free training offered by Mastermind Assurance. Given that I recently completed an [internal auditor training](/posts/iso27001-gdpr), this definitely seemed like the next logical step.

David Forman, author of the course, shared 3 months ago on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mastermindassurance_activity-7310104381822062593-6Aa0) that the course would be free only **for a limited period of time** ‚è∞. Therefore, I would encourage any reader who might be interested to sign up, even if they intend to start the course later. 

You may sign up for the course [here](https://learn.mastermindassurance.com/products/courses/iso-27001-lead-auditor).

## Description

The course encompasses 6 chapters, and a total of 34 lessons, covering the following material:
* Introduction
* The Basics
* Understanding the ISMS
* Implementing the Management System
* Planning for the Audit
* Executing the Audit

The content is purely video based, with recordings by David Forman, who happens to be an excellent teacher with a great sense of humor, but most importantly, truly passionate about the subject. In total, the length of the course videos is around 6 hours. The only catch, as a non-native English speaker myself, was the lack of subtitles.

At the end of each lesson, there's a simple quiz to test your knowledge. Upon finishing the course, you may take the final exam, which consists of 75 questions, requiring a minimum 80% score to pass. There's no time limit (as far as I am concerned), nor any kind of proctoring involved.

If you paid attention during the course, this should be more than enough to pass. 

The only questions I found tricky were the ones involving references to IAF MDs and other ISO standards besides 27001. 

## Impression

I was satisfied with the quality of the course, specially considering it's free. 

It provides a good overview of the audit process, ISO 27001, along with insightful client experiences. As a side note, I learned about the [IAF Cert Search](https://www.iafcertsearch.org/) database, which can be useful in order to verify the validity of certificates issued to an organization, including related accreditation and certification bodies.

This helps to build trust and transparency on business relationships.

Overall, I would recommend this course to anybody with prior training on ISO 27001, since it will reinforce their previously acquired knowledge. Specially, it could prove very valuable to both aspiring auditors, as well as implementers of ISMS willing to understand the audit side of things.

## Next steps

After studying the norm from an auditor perspective, I would like to delve into the implementation of Information Security Management Systems. As a first step, I will be taking Aron Lange's Udemy Course [ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Lead Implementer](https://www.udemy.com/course/information-security-for-beginners/).

This should serve as a foundation before enrolling on PECB [ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Implementer](https://pecb.com/en/education-and-certification-for-individuals/iso-iec-27001/iso-iec-27001-lead-implementer) accredited training.

As always, I will share my impressions in a new blog post.
